Ran into an unexpected problem with the allocation of the arrays. When we make the variable for holding the datatype for inputdata and output data for the IfW_Calculate routine, we might have to reallocate at each timestep. This is because the number of points we need information for might change (likely won't, but this could introduce a bug later if we do).

Anyhow, now I need to figure out how to allocate the receiving array also.

REVISION:
After talking with Bonnie, we will not do reallocation of arrays within the IfW_CalcOutput routine. Instead, we will just do error checking there to make sure they are allocated the same size. The rest will be handled by the glue code.



New plan:
   +  convert HHWind to framework -- some bits remaining in the first three routines.
   +  HHWind test routine
   -- Interface layer --> modify IfW_Module to handle the revisions to HHWind
   -- Make the Driver work with paraprint
   -- Setup regression test with HHWind
   -- do the other modules
   -- merge all the wind file types together (if possible)
   -- write documentation on use


Things to remember to change:
   -- UnWind -> UnitWind --> get this during init (stored in OtherStates)


TODO:
   -  Add information in the Parameters about how many time steps there are, bounds on time
   -  Add information in the Parameters about the bounds on the dimensions, steps and stepsize
   -  Add the other modular framework required routines into the file.

COMPLETED:
IfW_HHWind.f90
   +  properly allocate array for the output
   +  step through all points
   +  Err handling in CalcOutput
   +  Err handling in the GetWindSpeed function (upgrade to use ErrID levels etc)
   +  Err handling in Init
   +  Err handling in End
