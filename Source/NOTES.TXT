Ran into an unexpected problem with the allocation of the arrays. When we make the variable for holding the datatype for inputdata and output data for the IfW_Calculate routine, we might have to reallocate at each timestep. This is because the number of points we need information for might change (likely won't, but this could introduce a bug later if we do).

Anyhow, now I need to figure out how to allocate the receiving array also.

REVISION:
After talking with Bonnie, we will not do reallocation of arrays within the IfW_CalcOutput routine. Instead, we will just do error checking there to make sure they are allocated the same size. The rest will be handled by the glue code.

New plan:
  -- convert HHWind to framework
  -- HHWind test routine (get TurbSim sorted out so I can generate files)
  -- Interface layer --> modify IfW_Module to handle the revisions to HHWind
  -- Make the Driver work with paraprint
  -- Setup regression test with HHWind
