# InflowWind
A module for reading and interpolating wind inflow files

**Authors**: [Bonnie Jonkman](mailto:bonnie.jonkman@nrel.gov) and Andy Platt, NREL

InflowWind is a module for processing wind-inflow data. It has been coupled into the FAST version 8 
multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. InflowWind 
can also be driven as a standalone code to process wind-inflow data uncoupled from FAST.
